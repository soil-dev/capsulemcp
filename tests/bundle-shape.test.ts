/**
 * Bundle-shape canary tests.
 *
 * These assertions run against the built artifacts in `dist/`, not the
 * TypeScript source. They catch a small set of release-blocking
 * regressions that the unit tests (which import from `src/`) cannot
 * see:
 *
 *   - The stdio entry (`dist/index.js`) must start with the
 *     `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang. Without it, `npx capsulemcp`
 *     errors at spawn-time on Unix.
 *   - The HTTP entry (`dist/http.js`) must NOT have a shebang — it is
 *     not invoked as a CLI and a stray shebang would render the file
 *     as text in some loaders.
 *   - Both entries are reasonable size (sanity check, not a hard cap).
 *
 * Existing pre-release checklist items (HOWTO) cover bundle size
 * reporting in docs; this test pins the shebang invariant which is
 * checked nowhere else.
 *
 * The build is not run from this test — CI and the pre-release gate
 * run `npm run build` before `npm test`. If `dist/` is missing in a
 * quick local unit-test loop, this test skips rather than failing;
 * running tests against an unbuilt tree is a developer-experience
 * choice, not an error.
